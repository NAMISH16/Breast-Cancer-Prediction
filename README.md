**1. Problem Undedrstanding**

Breast cancer, the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases and affected 2.1 million people in 2015. Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.

The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign. Machine learning techniques can dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques. In this case study our task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features obtained from several cell images. Let's take a look at the cancer diagnosis and classification process. So the first step in the cancer diagnosis process is to do what we call it fine needle aspirate or FNA process which is simply extracting some of the cells out of the tumor. And at that stage we don't know if that tumor is malignant or benign. When we say malignant or benign as you guys can see these are kind of the images of the cell.

**2. Project Structure**

Main.ipynb file contains all the main code for this project. Open that if you want to read my work.
There is .pptx & .docx file which contains project Presentation & Report respectively. The report is in both word and pdf file.
The data used for this project has been imported from sci-kit learn library directly, so you wont find a data file for this project and wont need to install any seperately.
Finally there is a README file which you are reading right now.ðŸ“–
